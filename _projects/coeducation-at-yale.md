### Overview

*Co-Education at Yale: Through the Eyes of a Pioneer* examines the history of co-education on campus by following the journey of one of the first female students admitted to Yale College: Margaret Homans. Through the use of multimedia—including images, video, text, maps, archival photos, and visualizations—we're able to more fully reflect the early sentiment and experiences that accompanied Yale's transition.

The project's core research questions include:
1. How does the the experience of our chosen female student fit within the narrative of social upheaval in the late 1960s?

2. To what extent did inherent power structures influence the experiences of the first female undergraduates at Yale?

3. To what extent can a visual narrative accurately depict controversial history?

*This project was created as part of Professor Laura Wexler's "Intro to Digital Humanities" course in fall 2017, for which jub Sankofa was the DH Teaching Fellow.*
