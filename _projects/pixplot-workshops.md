### Indicate which days work for you
Do you have a digitized collection between 3,000-30,000 images that you would be interested in exploring in *PixPlot*? Would you like to experiment with *PixPlot*'s latest enhancements for clustering and exporting results? If yes, please indicate your availability on our <a href='https://www.when2meet.com/?8692471-Fi6wK' target='_blank'>planning calendar</a>. We will use the calendar to determine which two days will work best for holding the first workshop.

### Schedule & Logistics, Workshop 1
The *PixPlot* for Cultural Heritage workshop in New Haven will be scheduled as follows:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Pre-Day 1</td>
    <td>Smithsonian participants travel to New Haven</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Day 1</td>
    <td>9am-5pm, lunch provided</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Day 2</td>
    <td>9am-12:00pm, Smithsonian participants travel to Washington, DC</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Schedule & Logistics, Workshop 1
The *PixPlot* for Natural Science Collections workshop will take place in Washington, DC. Details are forthcoming.

### Overview
The mass digitization of visual collections from the libraries, galleries, and museums of Yale and the Smithsonian Institution has created unprecedented opportunities for discovery and interpretation. But the very scale of these digitized images has also introduced new challenges: existing methods of search are insufficient for the scale, and ill-suited for the characteristics, of these non-textual archives.

*PixPlot*, an open-source web application from the Yale Digital Humanities Lab, leverages machine learning and advanced web programming to enable collection-scale analysis: the interactive exploration of archives that range in size from tens of thousands to a million images. Working at the intersection of computer vision, archival description, and scholarly annotation, *PixPlot* allows curators, scholars, and the public to pursue questions that involve the scope of an entire collection. Several teams from both Yale and the Smithsonian Institution are already using *PixPlot* for purposes as diverse as fashion photography from *Vogue* and a visual collection of fern leaves.

The April 2019 <a href='https://dhlab.yale.edu/machine-vision/' target='_blank'>Machine Vision for Cultural Heritage and Natural Science Collections symposium</a> showcased a variety of research applications for *PixPlot* and led to in-person brainstorming that centered the role of curators and scholars in driving future software development.

Building on those conversations, Yale and the Smithsonian are partnering on two sets of hands-on workshops that will bring librarians, curators, and data science professionals together to explore their own collections in *PixPlot*. Participants will learn how to prepare, process, and visualize a collection of their choosing. No prior experience with programming is required, but participants will be asked to bring laptops with Chrome installed to the workshop.
