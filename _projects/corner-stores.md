### Digitizing and Humanizing Our Own Backyards
by Benjamin Oldfield

As a primary care pediatrician and health services researcher, I think often about the local milieu of my patients. How do social and structural forces at the neighborhood level contribute positively and negatively to a family’s health? Investigating that question requires several kinds of data—geospatial, survey data, local history, narrative, to name a few—in short, a perfect project for the digital humanities. And what better way to approach the question than in partnership with New Haven’s youth, experts themselves on their own neighborhoods. 

Together with Jerry Smart (a community health worker at Yale’s Transitions Clinic), Catherine DeRose (Digital Humanities Lab), and Miriam Olivares (GIS Librarian), we organized a five-day workshop for students of Yale’s Pathways to Science high school program, bringing them into the DHLab and then out into their own New Haven communities to collect and analyze data. The work was sponsored by a Seed Grant from the DHLab. For this pilot workshop, we focused on one important determinant of neighborhood health: local food systems. 

The workshop began with a guided tour through New Haven’s Newhallville neighborhood, where we discussed how space and place can impact and be impacted by health and wellbeing. We then took these ideas into the DHLab, where Catherine and Miriam provided us tools we could use to organize and visualize what we saw. One such tool, ESRI’s StoryMaps, provided an easily learnable platform for integrating text, survey, photo, video, and geospatial data all into one collaborative website. In small groups, we then went out into various New Haven neighborhoods to capture such data at small food establishments—interviewing store owners, documenting acceptance of food stamps or WIC, photographing facades and videoing our own shopping experience—to build a spatial library of corner stores. 

The students left the workshop with a completed website, new notions about food systems and the health of their city, and a toolbox for future projects. I was impressed at all they accomplished, and at the vast potential for youth-partnered research. I learned that the DHLab can be an important outlet for building youth capacity for research, particularly because it asks that they engage their creative sides, their scientific sides, and their storytelling sides all at once in order to create an engaging and beautiful product. I look forward to continuing to collaborate with the DHLab in other community-based participatory research projects.
