### William Blake's Color Theory

*Quantizing Color in William Blake’s Illuminated Books* studies the artistic output of the Romantic poet and painter, William Blake (1757-1827). Blake invented a complex process of etching and printing, a system he called "illuminated printing." His "infernal method" consisted of using an acid-resistant substance to mirror-write onto a plate of copper, which he then etched, printed, and reprinted. Throughout his lifetime, Blake would re-ink the same plate, using different colors every iteration, giving each copy with its own distinctive feel. This project wishes to study, on a micro- and macro-level, the changes Blake made to his plates over time in order to better understand his use of color and affect. 

The visualizations in *BlakeTint* give us fresh ways of looking at Blake’s manuscripts, providing new angles into understanding his complicated relationship with color.

On a macro-level, users can track: 
- how Blake’s color palette changes across the course of one book (from plate-to-plate)
- how Blake’s coloring of one book changes across copies (sorting by book) 
- how Blake’s general color scheme across all his books progresses over time (sorting by date).

On a micro-level, you can:
- spot minute differences and alterations Blake made to a single plate, using a sliding tool that compares two copies of the same image
- compare color palettes of two plates, bar-for-bar, side-by-side
- view a plate’s color palette multiple ways: equal-sized, proportional, and hue-only
- examine what the computer "sees" when it removes the background color from each plate and extracts the remaining color palette.
