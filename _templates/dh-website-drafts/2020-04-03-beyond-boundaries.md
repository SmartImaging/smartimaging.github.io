  What can automated color extraction reveal about nineteenth-century paintings? How might we indicate uncertainty when creating maps that span 270 years? When and why might we turn to machine learning? For answers to these questions and many more, join us for the fifth annual Beyond Boundaries symposium, a half-day event organized around hybrid scholarship at Yale.

What can automated color extraction reveal about nineteenth-century paintings? How might we indicate uncertainty when creating maps that span 270 years? When and why might we turn to machine learning? For answers to these questions and many more, join us for the fifth annual Beyond Boundaries symposium, a half-day event organized around hybrid scholarship at Yale.

Beyond Boundaries will be hosted in the Franke Family Digital Humanities Laboratory and will feature the work of Yale undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, postdoctoral associates, and staff on topics ranging from computer-generated models and text mining to interactive visual representations of data.

For last year's presentations, see the <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5j0it0mfLcs' target='_blank'>Lightning Talks</a> and <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExRYxT4CsQk' target='_blank'>Roundtable Discussion</a>.

Beyond Boundaries is organized by the Yale Digital Humanities Laboratory and sponsored by the Poorvu Center for Teaching and Learning. The symposium is open to the whole campus community and public. No advance registration is required.<br>
