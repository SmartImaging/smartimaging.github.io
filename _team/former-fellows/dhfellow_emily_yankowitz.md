Emily Yankowitz is a Ph.D. student in the Department of History. Her research focuses on how early Americans from the Revolution to the mid-nineteenth century understood the concept of citizenship. More broadly, she is interested in how political and cultural practices helped define national boundaries of inclusion and exclusion and shape understandings of “American” nationhood and identity before the Civil War. 

As a Digital Humanities Teaching Fellow for “Introduction to American History, 1492-1865,” Emily will integrate a wide range of digital projects into her teaching both to help students engage actors and voices that were often marginalized in early U.S. history and to showcase the numerous methods and approaches that historians can utilize to study the past.
