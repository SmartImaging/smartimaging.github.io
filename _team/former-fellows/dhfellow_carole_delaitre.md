Before starting her PhD at Yale, Carole graduated from the École Normale Supérieure (Ulm) in 2014 and earned a “Maitrise de Lettres Modernes” from the University of Paris-IV Sorbonne (2012). She was also a Visiting Lecturer at Smith College for two years and a Teaching Assistant at UMass Amherst for one year. Her dissertation examines the aesthetic representations and criticisms of mass tourism in the works of Jean-Paul Sartre, Violette Leduc, Michel Houellebecq and Marie NDiaye. Her research interests include 20th and 21st-century French and Francophone Literature, travel writing, spatial theory, and the redefinition of literary genres.

As a Digital Humanities Fellow for "Deserts, Oceans, Islands - Literatures of Migration and Refuge" with Professor Jill Jarvis, Carole will help students design digital presentations, digital posters and a digital atlas.
