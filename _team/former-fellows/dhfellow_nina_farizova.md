Nina Farizova is a PhD candidate in the department of East Asian Languages and Literatures. In her research, she theorizes modes of thinking and writing that are represented in premodern Japanese poetry. She is also interested in the relationships between literature and other media. Prior to coming to Yale, Nina had taught the Japanese language at the National Research University Higher School of Economics in Moscow. She received her BA and MA from Moscow University.

As a Digital Humanities Fellow for "Readings in Literary Japanese," Nina will help students gain confidence in reading a dead literary language through the use of digital tools.
