Sarah Weston is a joint PhD candidate in the English and History of Art Departments at Yale University. She specializes in British literature and art of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, with a particular interest in William Blake and Romanticism. Her other research interests include eco-criticism, sound studies, and nineteenth century media. She received B.A. degrees in English and Art History from Stanford University, and an MPhil in Eighteenth Century and Romantic Literature from the University of Cambridge. 

As a Digital Humanities Fellow for “Blake and Milton,” Sarah will help students use and interpret data from a digital humanities tool studying William Blake’s use of color in his hand-painted illuminated books. Additionally, she will introduce students to other digital methods they might use to interpret Blake or Milton’s poetry.
