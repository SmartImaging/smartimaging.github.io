Melissa Tu is a PhD candidate in the English Language and Literature department. Her research focuses on the ways that lyric poems of late medieval England engage with notions of voice, vocality, and sense-perception. 

As a DH Fellow for "Milton," Melissa aims to work with students to explore exciting ways of imagining, representing, creating, and analyzing voices as complex composites of sensory information. She is especially interested in implementing audio-visual resources, data analysis tools, and/or spatialization techniques in her teaching.
