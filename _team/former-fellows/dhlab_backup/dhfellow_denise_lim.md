Denise Lim is currently a Yale Graduate Alumni Fellow in the Sociology department, and a Strategic Initiatives Research Fellow at the Yale Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage. Denise's doctoral dissertation explored a Brutalist residential tower in Johannesburg called Ponte City. Originally developed as a bastion of white privilege, luxury, and global aspiration during apartheid, Ponte has since retained the mythological reputation of harboring socially deviant populations submerged in lives of crime, illicit activity, and urban decay. Collaborating with a diverse team of visual artists, urban architects, and web designers, Denise analyzed a vast collection of multimedia forms of data that explored the building’s rich geological, architectural, and urban heritage. Denise has been working to transform her dissertation into a digital project that demonstrates the great promise of digital scholarship and data curation in sociological education.
 
As a Digital Humanities Fellow for her course, “Space, Time, and the African City,” Denise aims to work with students to produce multimedia projects that draw upon innovative digital methods and tools to learn how to reimagine visual modes of knowledge production. Students will be encouraged to learn how to creatively design and present academic research on a curated selection of visual cultural artifacts assigned in the class, capturing diverse urban forms and cultures from six different African cities.
