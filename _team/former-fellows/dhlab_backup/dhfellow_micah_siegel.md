Micah Siegel is a Ph.D. student in the English department, where she studies the nineteenth- and twentieth-century novel. Her dissertation research examines how people thought about plot in the turn-of-the-century literary marketplace, drawing on materials like authors' manuals, self-proclaimed “novels without plots,” and Golden Age detective fiction.

This fall, Micah will be interning with the Digital Humanities Lab as a GSAS Professional Experience (GPE) Outreach Strategy Fellow. She also will be serving as a DH Teaching Fellow for ENGL 114 30: "Mysteries, Puzzles, and Clues," and looks forward to introducing her students to digital humanities tools and methodologies.
