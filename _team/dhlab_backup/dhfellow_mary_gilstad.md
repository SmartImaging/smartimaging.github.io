Mary is a PhD student in East Asian Languages and Literatures. Her dissertation investigates the concept of the poetry anthology as a trans-medial method of aesthetic engagement with and preservation of poetry through an analysis of the classical Japanese poetry (waka) anthologies of the Heian and Kamakura eras (794–1333) and the use of anthologies in early modern calligraphy albums (kohitsu tekagami) and collage folding screens (harimaze byōbu).

The course "Readings in Literary Japanese" is the second semester of a two-semester program in the premodern languages of Japan designed to give students the tools to enjoy and pursue research in Japanese premodern and early modern texts. As a Digital Humanities Teaching Fellow, Mary will introduce students to the variety of digital tools already in use for the teaching and learning of literary Japanese, showcase the use of the online annotation and publication software Mirador for ongoing research on a calligraphy album, and prompt students to reflect on the resonances between digital and analog methods of textual engagement and preservation.
