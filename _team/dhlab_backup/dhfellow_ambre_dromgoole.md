Ambre Dromgoole is a 4th-year PhD candidate in the departments of African American Studies and Religious Studies. Her dissertation, "There’s a Heaven Somewhere: Itinerancy, Intimacy, and Performance in the Lives of Gospel Blues Women, 1915-1983," positions the friendships, micro-interactions, and collaborations of an intimate circle of Black women gospel musicians as untilled sites of critical Black feminist engagement, sociohistorical investigation, and nuanced religious consideration.

This semester she is a teaching fellow for the course “Mapping Black Christianity,” which merges research in African American religious history with the creation of an interpretive archive using digital mapping and deep mapping practices.
