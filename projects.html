  <p>The Digital Humanities Lab supports DH research at every stage of development, depending on the unique needs of each project.</p>

  <p>If you are a student, staff, or a faculty member and your DH project is in its earliest stages of development (even if it is still just an idea) or if you are looking for hands-on guidance for development that is already underway, please <a href="https://dhlab.yale.edu/resources/consultations.html">schedule a consultation</a> with a member of our team to brainstorm possible directions for your work.</p>

  <p>The DHLab is also thrilled to partner with Yale staff, faculty, and collections to collaboratively develop user-centered DH products from scratch. If you have an idea for a possible DH project (this could be anything from digital exhibits, interactive databases, and network graphs, to tools to visualize metadata and tell important stories), please fill out our <a href="https://forms.office.com/pages/designpagev2.aspx?lang=en-US&origin=OfficeDotCom&route=Start&subpage=design&id=u76M3Tkh-E20EU4-h6vrXKKCBUYgw3tCqyXz86yveTdUNFBHS0JQRk9KVTBOT0VJTFVHNEtCRUdXVS4u">project proposal form</a> and a member of our staff will reach out to schedule a discussion about ways we could work together.</p>
