### Overview
Join us as the Enriching Exhibition Scholarship team share their ongoing work with linked exhibitions data and open the floor for feedback and discussion. The project team will provide an overview of the project, how they have been using the project data so far, and what they have learned in the process.  

The Enriching Exhibition Scholarship Project involves partners from the Universities of Edinburgh, Yale, Oxford, and the Ashmolean Museum and is funded by the AHRC/NEH. The work in enriching linked data records with information from museum exhibitions, mapping connections between art and museum objects across the world, creating information that will make arts knowledge more accessible and shareable for artists, scholars, and the public. This project uses advanced computational techniques, such as text mining and machine learning, to capture all sorts of exhibition data and allow museums to make it easily accessible and shareable to scholars and the public.
