  Create generative art with advanced machine learning techniques. This workshop will offer participants an overview of a variety of neural network architectures that can be used to generate digital artworks. We will cover autoencoders, recurrent neural networks, generative adversarial networks, and the ways that each of these techniques can be used to create images, text, and music.

### Overview
Create generative art with advanced machine learning techniques. This workshop will offer participants an overview of a variety of neural network architectures that can be used to generate digital artworks. We will cover autoencoders, recurrent neural networks, generative adversarial networks, and the ways that each of these techniques can be used to create images, text, and music.

While this workshop will cover advanced topics in machine learning, attendees do not need prior programming or machine learning experience to participate. 

Instructor: Douglas Duhaime (DHLab)
