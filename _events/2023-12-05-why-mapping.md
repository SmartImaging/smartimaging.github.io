  Learn more about digital mapping's importance for humanistic research at this virtual talk by Prof. Jinah Kim (Harvard). In addition to discussing new and ongoing DH mapping projects, Prof. Kim will connect DH's spatial turn to theoretical developments in art history and explain why mapping matters in the age of climate crisis.

### Overview
Spatial visualization and digital mapping rank among the key methodological interventions of the digital humanities. As Richard White has noted, mapping is not a mere illustration to a narrative, but “a means of doing research”—a methodology in itself. At this virtual event, Professor Jinah Kim will discuss new and ongoing research projects that place DH’s mapping capacity at the core of their agenda. Through discussions of two DH projects—the NEH-funded multidisciplinary project *Mapping Color in History*, and a new collaborative DH project tentatively titled *Mapping Visual and Material Culture of Monsoon Asia*—Professor Kim will situate the spatial turn enabled by DH methodologies amid the global and material turn in art history, and will consider why mapping matters for humanistic research in the age of climate crisis.  
  
*This event is co-sponsored by the Yale Graduate Digital Humanities Colloquium.*
