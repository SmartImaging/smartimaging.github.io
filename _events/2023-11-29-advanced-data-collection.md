### Overview
Are you having a hard time finding data for your project? Have you been thinking about turning to manual data collection (such as archival visits, surveys, and health record transcription) or web scraping to get the data you need?  

In this virtual workshop, co-hosted by staff from the Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library and the Digital Humanities Lab (DHLab), participants will learn about four advanced data collection methods: manual data collection, web scraping, data requests, and application programming interfaces (APIs).
