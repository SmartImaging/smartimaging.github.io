  Learn to create and analyze large datasets using ProQuest’s TDM Studio platform! These two virtual workshops—one for experienced R or Python programmers, and one for users of all levels—will explore how to use TDM Studio to mine ProQuest’s collections. Discussions will cover methods such as geographic analysis, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling.

### Overview
Learn to create and analyze large datasets using ProQuest’s TDM Studio platform! Taught by ProQuest instructors, these two virtual workshops will explore how to use TDM Studio to mine ProQuest’s collections, drawing on methods such as geographic analysis, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling. Each session will focus on a different pathway for using TDM Studio: 1) the Workbench interface, designed for those programming their own data analysis scripts in R or Python, and 2) the Visualization interface, which allows users with and without coding experience to gain insight into their datasets. 

### About ProQuest TDM Studio
TDM Studio is a data mining platform that offers researchers the ability to mine millions of newspaper articles, scholarly publications, and other works licensed through ProQuest. Designed for users of a range of programming skill levels, it provides a cloud-based environment for executing queries, developing datasets, and analyzing text, and features multiple interfaces and visualization options through which researchers can explore their data.

### Workshop Details and Registration Links
Both workshops will be held online; all Yale students, faculty, and staff are invited to participate, though space is limited. If you have additional questions, please contact [Barbara Esty](mailto:barbara.esty@yale.edu), Data Librarian at the Marx Science and Social Science Library.
