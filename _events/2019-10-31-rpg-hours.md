### Overview
Looking to discuss an idea for a Rapid Prototyping Grant? Have questions about the application or grant process? Stop by our special RPG Office Hours, where Digital Humanities Lab staff will be available to answer questions and share advice.

Rapid Prototyping Grants support focused design and development interventions to help a digital humanities project get started or to add an innovative feature to an existing project. These grants are intended to produce prototypes in the truest sense of the word: something that is the first of its kind and is a working model rather than a production-ready system. 

For more information and to apply, please visit the <a href='http://dhlab.yale.edu/awards/rapid-prototyping.html' target='_blank'>RPG webpage</a>. Applications are due December 6, 2019.
