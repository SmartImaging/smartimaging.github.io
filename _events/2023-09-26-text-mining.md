### Overview
Curious about how to start reading a large set of texts? Heard murmurings about topic modeling or sentiment analysis and want to know what the fuss is about?  

This workshop will introduce you to some basic techniques in text mining, as well as what they offer and require. Together, we will present the pros and cons of some key text mining methods, talk you through some example projects, and guide you in thinking about the privacy and ethical concerns that text mining may raise.  

No prior experience with text mining or coding is expected.
