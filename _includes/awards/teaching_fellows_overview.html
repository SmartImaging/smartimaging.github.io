    <p>As a DH Teaching Fellow, you are required to attend three meetings with your cohort and one training session. Additional optional training sessions will be provided as needed.
    <ul>
      <li>The first cohort meeting occurs at the beginning of the semester and is a chance to discuss goals, look through your syllabus, and identify what digital humanities methods or theories you might introduce to students.</li>
      <li>The second meeting occurs near the middle of the semester to check-in, share success stories and challenges, and set up any additional optional training sessions.</li>
      <li>The third meeting occurs near the end of the semester to reflect on the term and discuss possible next steps, such as additional training opportunities and describing your digital engagement in your teaching portfolio.</li>
      <li>Training sessions provide guided instruction on one or more digital humanities methods and are scheduled around Fellows' availability. Each Fellow will have a required training session that's connected to their class, but Fellows who are interested in learning additional tools, techniques, or theories or who would like to schedule follow-up discussions can request additional sessions. Training sessions are open to all Fellows to attendâ€”so even if you're not using networks in your class, but your cohort member is, you can also learn how to create networks.</li>
    </ul></p>

    <p>Which and how digital humanities methods or theories are integrated depends on the scope and goals of the class.</p>

    <p>Some Fellows introduce out-of-the-box tools to help students:
    <ul> 
      <li>map social movements in New Haven,</li> 
      <li>create network graphs of characters in a play,</li>
      <li>crowdsource annotations to develop close reading strategies,</li> 
      <li>perform text mining to study linguistic trends in novels.</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>Fellows do not have to incorporate tools in their classes. Sometimes Fellows:   
    <ul>
      <li>showcase digital projects that tie into the course</li> 
      <li>lead discussions on digital humanities readings.</li> 
    </ul></p>
    <p>During the award period, Fellows may reserve a desk for their use in the Franke Family Digital Humanities Laboratory for their office hours and work.</p>
