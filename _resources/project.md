The SmartImaging Lab supports medical imaging research at every stage of development, depending on the unique needs of each project.<br />

If you are a student or a faculty member and your medical imaging project is in its earliest stages of development (even if it is still just an idea) or if you are looking for hands-on guidance for development that is already underway, please schedule a meeting with a member of our team to brainstorm possible directions for your work.<br />

The SmartImaging Lab is also thrilled to partner with Tsinghua staff, faculty, and beyond to collaboratively develop Medical Imaging products from scratch. If you have an idea for a possible medical imaging project (this could be anything from digital software, private/public databases, to tools to visualize imaging data which provide clinical significance. Support with a project proposal form and a member of our staff will reach out to schedule a discussion about ways we could work together.<br />
