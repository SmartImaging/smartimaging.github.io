### Digital Humanities Lab

A unit of Yale University Library, the Digital Humanities Lab (DHLab) offers individual and group consultations for digital humanities projects at any stage of development, from conceptualization through implementation. Consultations are held by members of the DHLab staff and by our graduate student DH Consultants. With a variety of academic backgrounds and areas of expertise, we can provide guidance on a wide range of DH-related topics and can address questions related to project scope, planning, best practices, data management, tool selection, and more.    

To schedule an appointment with a member of the DHLab's staff, please use our [bookings form](https://schedule.yale.edu/appointments/dhlab).  <br/>

### Data, GIS, and Statistical Support Services at Marx Library

Librarians and statistical consultants at <a href='https://marx.library.yale.edu/data-gis-and-statistical-support-services-marx-library' target='_blank'>Marx Library</a> can provide you with services to help you find, use, and manage your research data. If you are looking for science or social science data, we can help you find publicly available sources or, in some cases, purchase data if it is not freely available. Once you have the data you need, we can help you find the resources at Yale that will allow you to manipulate and analyze your data.
