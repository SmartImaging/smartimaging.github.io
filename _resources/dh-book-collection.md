### Digital Humanities Reading
Digital humanities is a robust, rapidly developing area of research and teaching. To read the latest, stop by the DHLab and browse our collection of desk copies. The collection includes theoretical books, as well as ones that teach specific coding skills. For a complete listing of what we have, visit our <a href='http://www.librarything.com/catalog/YaleDHLab' target='_blank'>LibraryThing</a> page. If there is a book you need that you can't get, contact the DHLab to see if we could order a copy.

Also, to help collate resources for reading up on past and current methods and inquiries in digital humanities, we've created a collaborative <a href='https://www.zotero.org/groups/424703/yale_digital_humanities_lab/items?' target='_blank'>Yale Digital Humanities Lab Zotero</a> account. The site contains links to DH blogs, projects, tools, and syllabi.
