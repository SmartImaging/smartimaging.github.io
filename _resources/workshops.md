The Digital Humanities Lab leads workshops throughout the year on DH project development and related topics. These workshops are open to all Yale students, faculty, and staff, but sometimes space is limited, so please check to see if registration is required. You can find information about upcoming and past workshops below.  

Couldn't make a workshop? Most of our tutorials are posted to the DHLab's <a href='https://github.com/YaleDHLab/lab-workshops' target='_blank'>GitHub repository</a>.
