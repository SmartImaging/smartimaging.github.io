The Yale Digital Humanities Lab (DHLab) is excited to announce that Kayla Shipp will be joining us as our new Program Manager, beginning later this summer. Kayla comes to Yale from Emory University’s Center for Digital Scholarship, where she works as a digital scholarship specialist; in this role, she has partnered with museums, authors, and researchers to build interactive digital objects and publications. Previously, she earned an Ph.D. in English at Emory and an M.A. in Digital Humanities at King’s College London, studying the poetics of code and virtual space and the intersection of material culture and technology. Her work has been supported by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and the Fox Center for Humanistic Inquiry. 

Please join us in wishing Kayla a warm welcome! Her first day at the DHLab will be August 1, 2022. For more information about Kayla, and to see some of her recent projects and publications, visit <a href='http://kaylashipp.com/' target='blank
