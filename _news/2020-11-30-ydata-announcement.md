  Enroll in YData: Humanities Data Mining (S&DS 176/576) for Spring 2021! This new course will offer a survey of data science methods while tackling theoretical questions at the heart of the (digital) humanities. 
---

The Digital Humanities Lab is excited to announce a new Statistics and Data Science course—YData: Humanities Data Mining—that will be offered during the Spring 2021 semester. Co-taught by the DHLab's Catherine DeRose (Program Manager) and Doug Duhaime (Software Developer), S&DS 176/576 will survey data science methods for working with text and image data in the context of (digital) humanities research. It is open to all Yale undergraduate and graduate students—no prior programming or statistical experience required!
 
Designed for newcomers and experienced DH students alike, YData: Humanities Data Mining explores both the theory and practice of computational humanities research. In addition to providing hands-on training in some of the most popular methods in modern data science—classification, vectorization, and visualization—the class will consider how humanistic approaches can inform the work of algorithms in research and society at large. Each week will be divided into discussion and lab sessions, pairing theoretical concepts and humanities case studies with technical workshops. Through the class, students will have the opportunity to design their own data science projects while working with cultural heritage data.
