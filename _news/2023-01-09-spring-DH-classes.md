**Digital Platforms**  
AMST 268 / EP&E 399 / ER&M 295 / FILM 268  
Julian Posada  
  
Platforms—digital infrastructures that mediate between end-users and complementors—have emerged in various economic sectors, from social media (Instagram) and video streaming (YouTube) to ride-hailing (Uber), e-commerce (Amazon), and finance (PayPal). This multidisciplinary seminar studies platforms as hybrids of firms and multi-sided markets with unique governance and infrastructures. Through case studies from around the world, the class examines how platforms have transformed connectivity, labor, creativity, and democracy. It also considers how contemporary capitalism and digital economies intersect with topics such as inequality, surveillance, decentralization, and cooperation.
