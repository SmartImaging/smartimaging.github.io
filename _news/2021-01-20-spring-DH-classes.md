### YData: Humanities Data Mining
S&DS 176, S&DS 576  
Catherine DeRose and Douglas Duhaime   

What new modes of inquiry become available when we transform novels into bags of words and images into pixels? What is lost in the process? This course explores how we can use computational methods to pursue questions in the humanities, while also looking at how humanistic methods can inform the work of algorithms in research and society at large. Each course week is divided into discussion and lab sessions. Discussion sessions introduce concepts and humanities-based case studies that ground the hands-on technical work done in the labs. We will survey some of the most popular methods in modern data science—classification, vectorization, and visualization—to see what kinds of questions we can ask and answer.  

### AI Aesthetics  
ARCH 1246  
Brennan Buck  

More than any other technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises to transform design and architecture over the next several decades. AI’s impact is a question of economics: how will machine labor replace and alter human labor in the pursuit of greater efficiency and profitability? It is also question of aesthetics: how will machine vision and cognition alter and replace human creativity? Understanding this new machine-mediated visual culture is critical to addressing its growth, finding potentials and opportunities, and identifying avenues for critique and resistance.  

### James Baldwin's American Scene
AFAM 228, AMST 385, ENGL 265, HUMS 241  
Jacqueline Goldsby  

This course offers an in-depth examination of James Baldwin's canon, tracking his work as an American artist, citizen, and witness to United States society, politics, and culture during the Cold War, the Civil Rights era, and the Black Arts Movement. Students will have the opportunity to learn digital tools for projects in the class.

### Listening to Music
MUSI 175   
Angharad Davis  
DH Fellow Jacqueline Georgis  

This course will contribute to the development of aural skills that will lead to an understanding of Western music. The musical novice is introduced to the ways in which music is put together and is taught how to listen to a wide variety of musical styles, from Bach and Mozart, to Gregorian chant, to the blues.  

### Mapping Black Christianity
RLST 272   
Nicole Turner  
DH Fellow Ambre Dromgoole  

This course merges research in African American religious history with the creation of an interpretive archive using digital mapping and deep mapping practices. We explore the politics of mapping, geography, and race before delving into a place-based exploration of black religious communities during the late 19th century. The course aims to investigate the extant archives of black Christian communities of the post-emancipation South: newspapers, convention and church minutes, encyclopedias and autobiographies and narratives, while applying strategies of historical analysis to explore the nature of the formation and transformation of African American religious community.  

### Readings in Literary Japanese
JAPN 171  
DH Fellow Mary Gilstad  

This course is the second semester of a two-semester program in the premodern languages of Japan designed to give students the tools to enjoy and pursue research in Japanese premodern and early modern texts. Students will be introduced to the variety of digital tools already in use for the teaching and learning of literary Japanese. The class will reflect on the resonances between digital and analog methods of textual engagement and preservation.
