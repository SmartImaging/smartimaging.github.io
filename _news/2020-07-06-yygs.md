In a world of increasingly "big data," visualizations can make it easier to explore, interpret, and share patterns that nuance our understandings of history or shape policymaking at local and international levels.

In June, Digital Humanities Lab staff joined Yale Young Global Scholars for two sessions on data visualization best practices, highlighting tips, techniques, and common pitfalls. Putting theory into practice, each session then created a series of visualizations using an open dataset on internet users per 100 people organized by country and date. These visualizations were ultimately combined into an interactive data dashboard using <a href='https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/' target='_blank'>Tableau Public</a>.
