The Help Us Make History project, a Yale University Library initiative, seeks to document the academic and personal experiences of Yale undergraduates during the COVID-19 pandemic in the students’ own words and images. The materials gathered through this effort will be preserved in the Yale University Archives and serve as a critical resource for future students, historians, and others seeking to understand this extraordinary period in Yale’s history.
