## Outreach Strategy Fellow 
<br>

### Job Description
The GSAS Professional Experience (GPE) Fellowship is an exciting initiative by the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences that offers Ph.D. students the opportunity to work on meaningful projects in administrative offices across the university. This program is designed to expand opportunities for doctoral students, strengthen their professional skill set, and broaden their career exposure by working with experienced administrators outside of their academic programs. In turn, by hosting a fellow, offices across Yale can take advantage of the diverse array of skills that Ph.D. students offer to advance their programming and projects.

### About the Digital Humanities Laboratory
The Digital Humanities Laboratory (DHLab) offers space, community, and resources for Yale scholars who are using computational methods to pursue research questions in the arts, humanities, and humanistic social sciences. Along with creating open-source software that supports research at increasing scales, the DHLab also provides consultations and training in the areas of text and data mining, image computation, spatial analysis, and network analysis. As part of the Yale University Library, the DHLab participates in global conversations around the analysis and visualization of digitized cultural heritage collections.

### Fellow Responsibilities
Fellow Mentor: Catherine DeRose, Ph.D., Program Manager 

Working alongside the DHLab’s Program Manager, the Digital Humanities Fellow will assist in developing and implementing the DHLab’s communication and outreach strategies.

Depending on the fellow’s interests and expertise, projects may include:

- Writing print and web content on digital humanities projects, events, and opportunities happening locally and globally
- Designing and implementing event programming in the Franke Family Digital Humanities Laboratory
- Participating in digital humanities consultations with students, faculty, and staff.

### Preferred Qualifications
The DHLab will provide mentorship and technical training as needed for the position. Preferred qualifications for applicants include:

- Strategic planning and organizational skills
- Ability to work independently/take initiative
- Strong writing skills
- Effective team player
- Curiosity and willingness to learn.

### Learning Objectives
Through this position, the fellow will gain:

- Knowledge of digital humanities tools, techniques, and theories
- Familiarity with best practices in project and lab management, as well as in communication and outreach
- Experience working with and writing code for the web with version control software, including but not limited to HTML, Markdown, the Unix Shell, Git, and GitHub
- Experience collaborating on a digital humanities team that includes a director, program manager, user experience designer, and developers.  

Along with collaborating on DHLab initiatives, the fellow will have the opportunity to meet with DHLab staff—all of whom studied in the humanities and digital media—to learn more about their unique career paths and what prepared them for their current positions.

### Application
GPE Fellowships are open to Yale PhD students who will be in years 1-6 of their program during the time of the fellowship.
