The Beyond Boundaries symposium, scheduled for April 3, will be postponed until next year. If presentations can be circulated online, we will update the Beyond Boundaries event page.

In the meantime, you can watch previous years' talks on <a href='https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=yale+beyond+boundaries+symposium' target='_blank'>YouTube</a>! Presentations highlight a range of techniques and questions, from computer-generated poetry and stylistic analysis of judicial opinions to mapping Yale's history.
