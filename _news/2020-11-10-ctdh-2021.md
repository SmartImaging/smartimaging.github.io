### Call for Proposals
The Connecticut Digital Humanities Conference (CTDH) is inviting proposals for its second annual meeting, to be held virtually in February 2021. Proposals are due December 15, 2020. 

CTDH 2021 endeavors to bring together digital humanities practitioners from across the New England region, and to advance collaborative scholarship on all aspects of DH research and pedagogy. The conference will be held over the course of February 2021, with virtual sessions every Friday afternoon. It will conclude in the first week of March with an Art+Feminism Wikipedia edit-a-thon, co-organized by Trinity College, the Wikimedia Foundation, and the Connecticut Digital Archive. Conference participants will have the opportunity to learn new techniques and skills, hear about their colleaguesâ€™ DH projects, and become part of a vibrant and diverse community of scholars and practitioners. 

Organizers welcome proposals from faculty, unaffiliated scholars, librarians, technologists, and undergraduate and graduate students. To learn more about CTDH 2021, and to submit a proposal, please visit <a href='https://ctdh.io/ctdh-2021/' target='_blank'>the conference website</a>.
