### Call for Papers
*IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications* plans a May/June 2020 special issue on art and cultural heritage. Increasingly, digital technologies are employed for the digitization, restoration, conservation, presentation, and communication of our cultural heritage, as well as for providing new mediums for reflecting on our culture.

Conserving and presenting our cultureâ€™s precious artifacts for future generations has become a major challenge. One practical way to tackle the challenge is to apply visual computing technologies, including computer graphics, virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR), human-computer interaction (HCI), and visualization to provide more interactive, personalized, and knowledge-based experiences for understanding art and heritage. Experiments into digitally enabled presentations have led to enriching our experiences of our cultural heritage as well as contemporary culture. Digital humanities also provides a new and general paradigm in this rapidly developing field.

For this special issue, we are soliciting papers that describe the use of cutting-edge technologies for digital conservation, presentation, and communication in museums, galleries, and other cultural institutions. We are looking for computer graphics, VR/AR, HCI, visualization contributions related to, but not limited to the following topics within this domain:

- Digital modeling, representation and manipulation of artifacts
- Large scale digital reconstruction or restoration of artifacts
- Virtual and augmented reality technologies for museums or galleries
- Immersive art experiences in AR, VR, or surrounding environments
- Digital exhibition technologies
- Human-Computer interaction for physical or virtual exhibitions
- Digital narratives and storytelling to the mass audience
- Non photo-realistic rendering
- Emerging trends in digital humanities
- Artistic, cognitive and perceptional study of creative behavior
- Experiential art, driven by digital technologies
- Design, reproduction, fabrication of cultural and artistic artifacts
- Inventive uses of graphics and visualization within the arts and humanities
- Innovative computer graphics and visualization applications for cultural institutions

### Submission Guidelines
Final submissions due: 1 Oct 2019  
Publication date: May/June 2020

Non-department articles submitted to *IEEE CG&A* should not exceed 8,000 words, including the main text, abstract, keywords, bibliography, biographies, and table text, where a page is approximately 800 words. Articles should include no more than 10 figures or images. Each 1/4 page figure, image, and table counts for approx. 200 words. Note that all tables, images, and illustrations must be appropriately scaled and legible; larger elements should be accounted for accordingly with respect to word count. Please limit the number of references to the most relevant and ensure to delineate your work from relevant past articles in CG&A. Furthermore, avoid an excessive number of references to published work that might only be marginally relevant. Visit the *CG&A* style, length, and supplemental <a ref='computer.org/publications/author-resources/peer-review/magazines' target=>guidelines.
