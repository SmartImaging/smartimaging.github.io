Looking to learn more about the digital humanities this summer? Apply for a DH Training Scholarship! The Yale Digital Humanities Lab (DHLab) is excited to announce a limited number of $500 scholarships for Yale students and library staff participating in digital humanities workshops at other institutions.

### Application & Scholarship Information
- All Yale students and library staff are eligible to apply, as the workshop they've identified focuses primarily on the digital humanities and is at least three days long. 
- Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis until funds are exhausted. 
- DH Training Scholarships for summer 2021 may only be applied toward registration fees, not travel expenses. Many of this summer's workshops are being offered virtually.

### Summer Workshops  
Below are some of the institutes previous Yale recipients have attended that are being offered again this summer. Many of the programs offer additional funding in the form of scholarships and reduced fees that may be coupled with a DHLab Training Scholarship. Applications to participate in a workshop not listed below will also be considered, so long as the workshop is digital humanities intensive and three or more days in length.
