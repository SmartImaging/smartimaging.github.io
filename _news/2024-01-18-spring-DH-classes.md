**Digital War**  
AMST 305, EP&E 247, ER&M 330, FILM 298, SAST 262  
Madiha Tahir  
  
From drones and robots to algorithmic warfare and virtual war gaming, digital war has become a key issue of our times. Not only has warfare been shaped by digital technologies; technologies such as GPS, stealth technology, personal computing, and the Internet also have been conditioned through conflict. This class provides a critical overview of these links. Drawing on visual media, fiction, art, and scholarly texts, students will examine digital war’s connections to colonialism and imperialism, as well as its effects on those targeted.

**Platforms and Cultural Production**  
AMST 365, EP&E 399, ER&M 295, FILM 268  
Julian Posada  
  
Platforms—digital infrastructures that mediate between end-users and complementors—have emerged in a range of economic sectors, from social media (Instagram) and video streaming (YouTube) to digital labor (Uber) and e-commerce (Amazon). Through case studies from around the world, this multidisciplinary seminar examines how platforms have transformed connectivity, labor, creativity, and democracy, and considers how contemporary capitalism and digital economies intersect with inequality, surveillance, decentralization, and cooperation.  
  <br>
  
**Militarism, Technology, Empire**  
AMST 610, ER&M 610  
Madiha Tahir  
  
Scholarship on empire has yet to substantially inform studies of “digital war” or “digital militarism”—the digitally mediated technologies of war and militarism, including so-called “autonomous” weapons, data and algorithms, and biometrics. This graduate seminar aims to connect these areas of study, paying special attention to how technology enables and complicates militarist imperial formations. Students will pursue a variety of readings on contemporary militarism and war, considering how fields such as anthropology, STS, and media studies analyze contemporary militarist techno-formations.  
  <br>

**Imaging Ancient Worlds in Museum Collections**   
ANTH 492, ARCG 492, NELC 321, NELC 585  
Agnete Lassen and Klaus Wagensonner  
  
This class explores the merits, challenges, and best practices of the digitization of cultural heritage. Through hands-on engagement with the archaeological artifacts in the <a href='https://babylonian-collection.yale.edu/' target='_blank'>Yale Babylonian Collection</a>, students will learn how new computer graphics technologies, including 3D imaging, can be used to document and interpret archaeological artifacts, and will consider ways that these technologies can support current research in archaeology and anthropology.

  <br>

**Decentering Computer Science: Transpacific Computing History across U.S., East Asia, and Beyond**  
CPSC 190, EAST 201  
Yoehan Oh  
  
Semiconductor manufacturing and its advanced uses, such as artificial intelligence, play a key role in mediating relationships between China, Taiwan, and the U.S. This seminar examines how these transpacific relations between the U.S. and East Asian countries transcend simple “friend or foe” rivalries, revealing how they have shaped the history of computer science. Topics include China-born first-generation digital computer pioneers, the digitization of Asian characters, the development of transpacific computer and labor networks, and transpacific work to build CS fundamentals. The course will culminate with a discussion of exclusionism, trade protectionism, and “friendshoring” across the Asia-Pacific region.

**Telling Stories With Maps: From Ancient Times to the *New York Times***  
CSTD 200  
Aaron Reiss  
  
From ancient mariners’ best guesses of what exists beyond the known world to high-tech visual journalism in modern war zones, maps have been used to construct narratives, make arguments, and find sense in the abstract. How do maps play a role in border conflicts or colonial occupations? How can maps change our understanding of where we come from? How can we read the biases and points of view inherent in a given map, or put forward our own? Students tackle these questions through academic texts, investigative visual journalism, close readings of maps, and making maps of their own. By employing the cartographic and narrative strategies studied in class, students become visual journalists and digital storytellers in their own right.  
  <br>

**Politics of East Asian Digital Media Culture**  
EALL 298, EAST 302, FILM 345  
Tian Li  
  
East Asian digital media has reshaped global, national, and regional imaginings of East Asia. What role do these screen cultures play in the border-crossing interplay among languages, ideologies, aesthetics, and affect? How do we understand East Asian screen cultures’ storytelling and politics in relation to sociohistorical context? How do they capture local and global desires? Through discussions of (trans)nationalism, (un)translatability, locality and globality, (post)modernity, virtuality and actuality, and gender, students will learn to think and write about the screen cultures of East Asia in particular, and of our contemporary moment writ broadly.   
  <br>

**Philosophy of Digital Media**  
ENGL 188, FILM 210  
Hadar Levy-Landesberg  
  
This class investigates fundamental and theoretical questions regarding media, culture, and society, from the consequences of a computerized age to what is “new” in new media. Students will consider digital media from both philosophical and historical perspectives, focusing on the past five decades. Topics of discussion will include animals, democracy, the environment, gender, globalization, mental illness, obscenity, piracy, privacy, the public sphere, race, religion, social media, terrorism, and war.  
  <br>
  
**Geographic Information Systems**  
EVST 290, URBN 319  
Charles Tomlin
