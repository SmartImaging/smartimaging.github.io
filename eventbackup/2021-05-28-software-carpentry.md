### Overview
Learn new computing and software skills this summer through our Library Carpentry workshop series! Led by instructors from the Yale Digital Humanities Lab and the Marx Science & Social Science Library, this series will provide training in working with data in spreadsheets, OpenRefine, and Python. The individual workshop sessions will be held via Zoom the mornings of June 10, 11, 17, and 18. Please try to attend all if you sign up.

Library Carpentry aims to help researchers work more efficiently and effectively by teaching them the basics of research computing. The hands-on, collaborative workshop series will cover key concepts and tools for data management, analysis, and programming, and it will encourage participants to apply these skills to their own research problems. No prior knowledge of spreadsheets, OpenRefine, or Python is required.
