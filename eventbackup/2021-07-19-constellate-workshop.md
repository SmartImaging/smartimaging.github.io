### Overview
Learn how to analyze texts using Constellate, ITHAKA's new tool for text and data mining. This eight-session "Introduction to Text Analytics" series will take place every Tuesday and Thursday, from July 20 through August 12. Throughout the series, participants will become more familiar with Constellate and text mining more generally, with workshops covering a range of topics, from programming in Python to analyzing metadata, word frequencies, significant terms (TF-IDF), and topic models (LDA).

While participants are encouraged to take each workshop in the series, they could join midway through if they have prior experience with programming or text analysis.

### About Constellate

Constellate makes it easier to mine data from a variety of sources, including *JSTOR*, *Portico*, *Chronicling America*, *Documenting the American South*, and more. Designed to support the teaching and learning of digital humanities skills, the tool contains guides on programming, digital pedagogy, dataset construction, and analysis. 

Constellate is currently in a beta evaluation period with Yale and other partner institutions. To try the tool, please visit <a href="https://constellate.org/" target="_blank">Constellate's website</a>.
