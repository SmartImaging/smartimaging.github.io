### Overview
Learn how to work with images in Python! Many programming workshops focus on how you can use Python for text analysis, but in fact, it is also useful for studying images at scale. In this workshop, we'll demonstrate how we can use Python to extract color palettes from a collection of images. Along with discussing popular technical approaches, we will also introduce color spaces and theories of color perception, which will affect what algorithms we choose for specific tasks. 

The sixth offering in our Python for Humanists series, this workshop is designed for participants who have taken the earlier sessions or who otherwise have a general understanding of Python’s syntax and data types. Written tutorials from the prior sessions can be found on the <a href='https://github.com/YaleDHLab/lab-workshops' target='_blank'>DHLab's workshop repository</a> on GitHub.

Instructors: Catherine DeRose (DHLab) and Doug Duhaime (DHLab)
