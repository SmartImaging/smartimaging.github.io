### Overview
Learn how to track a word's semantic meaning over time with word embedding models. This workshop will introduce "word embeddings," also known as vectorized representations of words, to show how they can be used to study patterns of linguistic similarity within and across text documents. In addition to discussing what word embeddings are and why you might want to use them, we will also look at how you can create and visualize them using the Python programming language.

This workshop is designed for participants who have taken or worked through the materials for the <a href='https://yale.app.box.com/v/python-dhlab' target='_blank'>Python for Humanists workshop series</a> or who have some experience working with a programming language. 

Instructors: Douglas Duhaime (DHLab) and Joshua Dull (DHLab)
