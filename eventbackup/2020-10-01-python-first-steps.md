Curious about Python but not sure where to start? This workshop will introduce the basics of the Python programming language. Participants will learn how to perform common programming tasks in order to build familiarity with Python's syntax and best practices.

In particular, we will cover:

- reading and writing files,
- finding and importing Python libraries,
- using built-in functions to perform tasks.  

Designed for participants who have no prior programming experience, this workshop will serve as a foundation for upcoming DHLab workshops on text and data mining.

Instructors: Catherine DeRose (DHLab) and Douglas Duhaime (YUL)
