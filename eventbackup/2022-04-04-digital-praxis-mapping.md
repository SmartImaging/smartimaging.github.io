### Overview
Learn more about digital mapping at the next event in the Digital Praxis in the Humanities conversation series! Spearheaded by the DH@Yale group, Digital Praxis in the Humanities invites leading DH scholars to reflect on four key practices of digital scholarship—editing, archiving, mapping, and databasing—and the new research questions and outcomes that these practices have generated. This discussion of mapping will feature Ángel David Nieves (Northeastern University) and Roopika Risam (Salem State University), with a response from Laura Wexler (Yale University).
