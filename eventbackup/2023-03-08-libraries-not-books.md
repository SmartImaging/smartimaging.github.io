### Overview
Ever wondered about all the objects museums don’t have on view? Curious about which people in an archive are sending letters to each other? Want to think about collections, not just objects? Metadata might be a place to start! In a humanities context, metadata—data about data, or in this case data about books, art, or other collected subjects of humanistic inquiry—can include titles, authors’ or artists’ names, place and date of creation, and other key facts. This workshop will help you understand this kind of data, and get you started on learning how to find and use it. Learn a little bit about APIs, JSON files, data visualizations, and more, while thinking about a kind of humanities data you might work with in a variety of academic and non-academic careers. No programming experience required.
