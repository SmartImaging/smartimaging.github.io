### Overview
This workshop will provide a broad overview of network analysis. We'll cover what networks are, how you can interpret and create them, and why you might want to use them in your research. 

After discussing what networks are and how to read them, instructors will open two breakout rooms: one will demonstrate how to generate networks using <a href='https://gephi.org/' target='_blank'>Gephi</a> (off-the-shelf software, no programming required) and the other will walk through using <a href='https://networkx.org/' target='_blank'>NetworkX</a> (a Python library for creating networks). Participants will have the option to choose which breakout room they will join.

This workshop is designed for participants who are new to network analysis concepts and tools.

Instructors: Catherine DeRose (DHLab) and Doug Duhaime (DHLab)

### Registration & Requirements

This workshop is open to Yale students, faculty, and staff, but space is limited. To register, visit the <a href='https://schedule.yale.edu/event/7079553' target='_blank'>YUL Instruction Calendar</a>.

Participants who plan to use <a href='https://gephi.org/' target='_blank'>Gephi</a> should install the software prior to the workshop. If you have trouble with the installation, stop by the Digital Humanities Lab’s <a href='https://dhlab.yale.edu/resources/office-hours.html' target='_blank'>virtual Office Hours</a> for help.

Participants who plan to use NetworkX should have taken the DHLab's <a href='https://dhlab.yale.edu/events/2020-10-01-python-first-steps.html' target='_blank'>"First Steps with Python"</a> workshop or should otherwise have a general understanding of Python’s syntax and data types. If you missed or want to review what was covered in "First Steps with Python," you can find the tutorial on the <a href='https://github.com/YaleDHLab/lab-workshops' target='_blank'>DHLab’s GitHub repository</a>.
