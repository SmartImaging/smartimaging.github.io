### About the Presenters

**Estelle Guéville** is a PhD student in Medieval Studies at Yale. She previously worked for cultural institutions in France and the Gulf, including the Louvre Abu Dhabi, where she developed digital research and outreach. She participates in several DH projects and is the co-creator of the Paris Bible Project, a digital humanities initiative studying abbreviations and special letter forms as markers of scribal practices. In her dissertation, she aims to recover the history of medieval female scribes, using both traditional and digital methods of history and art history.  

**Carson Koepke** is a PhD candidate in the Medieval Studies Program. His research interests broadly include medieval narrative poetry, hagiography, manuscript studies, and literary exchanges between the Byzantine Empire, Italy, the Carolingian Empire, and Early England. He applies digital methodologies, including GIS mapping and complex network analysis, to his research on the circulation of saints’ lives. In his dissertation, he uses the popular and widespread legend of St. Eustace Placidas to examine the myriad ways that Christian saints’ lives responded to early medieval literary and intellectual culture in the wider Mediterranean region and Europe.  

**Kimberly Lifton** is a PhD student in the Medieval Studies Program. She holds a BA from Hamilton College and an MPhil from the University of Cambridge. Her dissertation research considers how knowledge of changing geopolitics in the Islamic world during the fifteenth century reached England, Burgundy, and France. The dissertation project draws together political documents, art, and literature to expose the influence of knowledge collection on fictional representations of Muslims. In the digital humanities, Kimberly has worked on several projects involving handwritten text recognition and natural language processing.  

**Avital Romach** is a PhD student in the Department of Near Eastern Languages & Civilizations, specializing in cuneiform studies. She employs computational methodologies to study the ancient world and ancient languages in particular. She has experience with the Python programming language, optical character recognition (OCR) for ancient scripts, and text analysis methods.   

**Katy Wilson** is a PhD student at the Yale School of the Environment. She holds a BA (Hons) in Geography from the University of Cambridge, and a MA in Climate and Society from Columbia University’s Climate School, where she was a Fulbright Scholar. Katy’s research focuses on how companies can reshape their business models to transition toward a net-zero economy.
