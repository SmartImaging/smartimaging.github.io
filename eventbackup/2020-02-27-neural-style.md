### Overview

Learn more about the intersections of art and AI and how you can incorporate both into your work using <a href='https://runwayml.com/' target='_blank'>Runway ML</a>. This session will provide an overview of neural style transfer, an algorithmic technique that applies the “style” of one digital image to the “content” of another. In particular, we will focus on the use of neural style transfer in creative art practice by generating images in Runway ML, out-of-the-box software that lets you apply style transfer techniques to your own images.

This hands-on workshop is designed for participants who are new to neural style transfer. No computer programming experience is required. 

Instructor: Catherine DeRose (DHLab)

*This event is co-organized by the Yale Digital Humanities Laboratory and Robert B. Haas Family Arts Library.*
